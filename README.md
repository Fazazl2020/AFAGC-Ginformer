## **ðŸ“– Dataset**  
This project used the [**VoiceBank-DEMAND**](https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2791) dataset. This dataset consists of **30 speakers** from the VoiceBank corpus, which is further divided into a **training set (28 speakers)** and a **testing set (2 speakers)**.  

- **Training Set:** 11,572 utterances from 28 speakers mixed with **DEMAND noises** and artificial background noises at SNRs of **0, 5, 10, and 15 dB**.  
- **Testing Set:** 824 utterances from 2 unseen speakers mixed with **unseen DEMAND noises** at SNRs of **2.5, 7.5, 12.5, and 17.5 dB**.  

ðŸ“Œ To **train/test**, please download the dataset from [**VoiceBank-DEMAND**](https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2791).
